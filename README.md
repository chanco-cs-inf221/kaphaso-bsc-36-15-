personal web app development project
In this project I developed a simple game Rock paper scissors using html, css and javascript.It's not that complex and can take you a few hours to develop if you are good at the concepts. Feel free to download the code and try it yourself. You may aslo be able to find videos on youtube that can be of great help. Happy coding!
